* Create a CandidateValidator class to implement the validation logic.
* Implement a method validateCandidates in the CandidateValidator class that takes a list of Candidate objects as input and returns a list of eligible candidates' names sorted alphabetically.
* Inside the validateCandidates method, use the Stream API to process the list of candidates.
* Use the filter operation to select only the candidates that meet the eligibility criteria.
1. Check if the candidate's age is older than 35 using the getAge method.
2. Check if the candidate is allowed to vote using the isAllowedToVote method.
3. Check if the candidate has Ukrainian nationality using the getNationality method.
4. Check if the candidate has lived in Ukraine for 10 years by processing the periodsInUkr field appropriately.
* Use the map operation to extract the names of the eligible candidates.
* Use the sorted operation to sort the candidate names alphabetically.
* Collect the sorted candidate names into a list using the collect operation.
* Return the list of sorted candidate names.
By following these steps, you can implement the validateCandidates method in the CandidateValidator class to validate the candidates and obtain the names of eligible candidates sorted alphabetically.


Define the CandidateValidator class: Create a new Java class called CandidateValidator.

Create the validateCandidates method: Add a public method named validateCandidates in the CandidateValidator class. The method should take a list of Candidate objects as input and return a list of eligible candidates' names sorted alphabetically.

Validate the candidates: Inside the validateCandidates method, iterate over the list of candidates and apply the eligibility criteria to filter out the eligible candidates.

Define the eligibility criteria: Determine the eligibility criteria based on the task requirements. Check each candidate's attributes (such as age, nationality, allowedToVote, and periodsInUkr) to determine if they meet the requirements.

Filter the candidates: Use the Stream API's filter operation to filter the candidates based on the eligibility criteria you defined. This will result in a stream of eligible candidates.

Extract the names: Use the Stream API's map operation to extract the names of the eligible candidates from the stream.

Sort the names: Apply the Stream API's sorted operation to sort the extracted names alphabetically.

Collect the sorted names: Use the Stream API's collect operation to collect the sorted names into a list.

Return the list: Return the final list of eligible candidates' names from the validateCandidates method.~~
